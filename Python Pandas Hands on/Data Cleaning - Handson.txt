# Create a dataframe named df_A which contains the height and weight of five students namely s1, s2, s3, s4, s5.
#   * Label the Columns as Student_height and Student_weight, respectively.
#   * Set height and weight values of student s3 to NaN.
#   * Set the weight of s5 to NaN.
#   * Drop the rows having null values in any of the columns, and assign the result to df_A2.
