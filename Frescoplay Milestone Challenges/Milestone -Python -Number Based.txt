Milestone - Coding - Python - Number Based

Problem Statement:

Create the test() function, which takes the integer "n" as input and prints the following output:

• Sort a number in descending order

• Determine whether the number in descending order is a prime or not. If the number is a prime, then print "Sorted Number is a prime number," otherwise, print "Sorted Number is not a prime number."

• Determine all of the factors of the descending order number.

• Finally, sort the given number to ascending order.


Input Format For Custom Testing

Input is the integer 'n'


Sample Case 0

Sample Input

78343

Sample Output

87433
Sorted number is a prime number
1
